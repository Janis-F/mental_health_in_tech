# The Importance of Positive Mental Health in the Workplace

Positive mental health is important because it allows individuals to cope with challenges, even good ones, and setbacks in their lives, both at work and at home. Positive mental health at work helps teams remain agile when changing roles and responsibilities. Not to mention facing difficult challenges. Research by Pricewaterhouse Coopers has shown that for every dollar a business spends creating a mentally healthy workplace can, on average, result in a positive return on investment (ROI) of 2.3. Thus, an employer who promotes mentally healthy work culture and invests in their empolyee's mental well-being has so much to gain.

The Mental Health Foundation has set out 3 main elements that mentally healthy organisation has in place:

1. a positive psychologically healthy organisational environment;
2. a proactive, fair and empathetic approach to mental health concerns including mental illness in the workplace; and
3. supporting employees to engage in activities that boost positive mental health and wellbeing.


Mental wellbeing is one of the most valuable business assets. **Workplaces that prioritise mental health** have **better engagement**, **reduced absenteeism** and **higher productivity**, while **people have improved wellbeing**, **greater morale** and **higher job satisfaction**.


This project examines what influences people's willingness to speak up about mental health at work. Is that a person's own experience with mental health or is it a mental health-friendly culture within the workplace?

## Main Findings

1. Imbalanced demographic data in the survey may lead to skewed results, and more balanced demographics are needed for generalizable conclusions.
2. Workplace culture and employer investment in mental health benefits significantly impact an employee's comfort in discussing mental health issues at work.
3. Mental health diagnosis itself does not affect willingness to discuss mental health in the workplace, but diagnosed individuals are less likely to mention it during interviews.
